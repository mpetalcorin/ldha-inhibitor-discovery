# LDHA Drug Discovery Capstone Project

## Project Overview
This project combines artificial intelligence and drug discovery to identify potential inhibitors of LDHA (Lactate Dehydrogenase A), a key enzyme involved in cancer cell metabolism. By using bioactivity data, machine learning models, and molecule-generating AI (ChemGPT + SELFIES), we developed a full pipeline that screens both known and novel molecules.

## Why LDHA?
LDHA is essential for the Warburg effect — a process where cancer cells produce energy. Blocking LDHA may starve cancer cells and stop tumor growth.

## Methods and Models Used
- Data sources: BindingDB, ChEMBL, COCONUT
- Features: Mordred descriptors, Morgan fingerprints
- ML Models Tried: LightGBM, XGBoost, Random Forest, SVM, etc.
- Best model: LightGBM (AUC = 0.97)
- Explainability: SHAP feature attribution
- Drug-likeness: QED, Lipinski RO5, LogP, MW, TPSA, solubility

## Pipeline Highlights
- SMILES-based dataset creation and deduplication
- Feature extraction via Mordred and RDKit
- Dataset balancing via SMOTE
- Model training and optimization via Optuna (Bayesian Optimization)
- Visualization of ROC curve, learning curve, confusion matrix
- Molecule generation using ChemGPT + SELFIES
- Streamlit app for public exploration

## Run the Web App
Upload SMILES strings and predict LDHA inhibition + drug-likeness metrics.

## Run Locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mpetalcorin/ldha-drug-discovery-capstone.git
cd ldha-drug-discovery-capstone
streamlit run app.py

# Model Card

## Model Description
**Name:** LDHA LightGBM Classifier  
**Input:** 100 selected Mordred molecular descriptors  
**Output:** Binary prediction (Active/Inactive), probability of LDHA inhibition  

## Intended Use
To predict whether a molecule is likely to inhibit LDHA based on bioactivity data and physicochemical features.

## Performance
- AUC: 0.97 (5-Fold Cross Validation)
- Accuracy: 96%
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, SHAP interpretability

## Training Data
- Source: Combined ChEMBL and BindingDB datasets
- Size: 2794 molecules
- Balance: Achieved via SMOTE

## Ethical Considerations
- Predictions are not substitutes for experimental assays.
- Requires expert validation before clinical use.

## Limitations
- Model trained on limited bioactivity data
- Applicability domain constrained to similar chemical space

## Update Policy
This model will be updated when additional validated LDHA inhibitors become available or new descriptors are integrated.

# Datasheet for LDHA Inhibitor Dataset

## Motivation
- Created to train AI models to classify LDHA inhibitors.
- Aims to accelerate cancer drug discovery by targeting cancer metabolism.

## Composition
- Compounds sourced from BindingDB and ChEMBL (SMILES + bioactivity)
- Activity labels: Active vs. Inactive based on IC50/pChEMBL thresholds
- Final dataset: 2794 entries (after merging, deduplication, and balancing)

## Collection Process
- Merged datasets via canonical SMILES
- Removed duplicates and outliers
- Balanced with SMOTE

## Preprocessing
- Feature extraction using Mordred descriptors (1668 → top 100)
- Calculated QED, LogP, MW, TPSA, Lipinski RO5 for drug-likeness

## Distribution
- Data saved in CSV files (`LDHA_inhibitors_SMOTE_balanced_with_SMILES.csv`)
- Public domain from BindingDB/ChEMBL with appropriate citation

## Uses
- ML model training for LDHA inhibition
- Scoring molecules generated by AI models (ChemGPT)
- Supporting Streamlit web-based screening

##  What this project is all about?

This project focuses on applying machine learning and generative AI to discover potential small molecule inhibitors targeting **Lactate Dehydrogenase A (LDHA)** — a key enzyme in cancer metabolism. By combining predictive models and generative chemistry, this pipeline identifies, scores, and ranks candidate molecules from natural product databases and AI-generated libraries.
##  LDHA as a Drug Target
**LDHA** plays a critical role in the Warburg effect, allowing cancer cells to survive under low oxygen by converting pyruvate to lactate. Inhibiting LDHA disrupts cancer metabolism, making it an emerging **anticancer therapeutic target**. This project leverages bioactivity data to train predictive models for LDHA inhibition.
